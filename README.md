Program contains:
* Fast, handy images gatherers
* Dataset generation with images libraries
* Smol neural network
* A super browser extender that concatenates js and python, using it you can make useful tools that will have access to both data in the browser and to local calculations in python. For example, I wrote small script that estimates images on webpage in realtime.
